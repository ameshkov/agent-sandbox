# Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (ARM64) sandbox image — VMware (Fusion) build.
#
# Built with the Packer vmware-iso plugin on Apple Silicon (the vmware-iso
# builder drives VMware Fusion, which virtualizes ARM64 guests natively):
# Ubuntu Server ARM64 ISO + Subiquity autoinstall (seed served over HTTP).
# See images/ubuntu-arm64-vmware/README.md for the full build flow — the
# Ubuntu ISO is bring-your-own (not redistributable via Packer), so it is
# not part of this repo.

# in the release SHA256SUMS (https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/24.04/release/);
# paste it here to enable integrity verification. Set UBUNTU_ISO_PATH to the
# local ISO path when building. Empty = skip verification.
