# Source: VMware (Fusion on Apple Silicon, ARM64 guest)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Windows 11 ARM64 runs natively on VMware Fusion on Apple Silicon — the
# most proven Windows-ARM path (Fusion ships the ARM64 guest drivers and
# tools). The recipe mirrors the reference implementation in
# gusztavvargadr/packer (src/windows/source.vmware.pkr.hcl +
# samples/windows-11/images.pkrvars.hcl, Unlicense), adapted to this repo's
# conventions:
#   - guest_os_type "arm-windows11-64", hardware version 20, NVMe disk,
#     vmxnet3 NIC under NAT, EFI firmware — the proven ARM64 combo,
#   - the unattend CD also carries the vmxnet3 ARM64 network driver
#     (drivers/staging/, staged by build.sh from Fusion's
#     Contents/Library/isoimages/arm64/drivers-arm64.zip). Without it there
#     is NO NIC in the guest and WinRM is unreachable from the host — the
#     driver must land before any network use (FirstLogonCommands order 1),
#   - VMware Tools ARM64 (the ISO Fusion bundles at
#     Contents/Library/isoimages/arm64/windows.iso) is attached by the
#     builder (tools_mode "attach"); autounattend.xml installs it at
#     first logon, before WinRM — the installer rebinds the NIC and
#     would kill a live WinRM session (observed as"dial tcp ... wsman:
#     operation timed out"). Tools
#     are what make vmrun's getGuestIPAddress work in the sandbox runner,
#   - NVMe storage needs no extra driver: Windows 11 ARM64 has the NVMe
#     driver in-box (unlike QEMU's virtio disk, which needs viostor in
#     WinPE).
#
# No snapshot is created (snapshot_name): the sandbox runner makes a full
# vmrun clone as its working VM, and a snapshot inside the published image
# would only complicate disk compaction and re-clones.
