Local sandbox virtual machines for AI coding agents. A pre-built image with
the full toolchain (macOS with Xcode/Homebrew, Windows 11 ARM64 with
VS2022/toolchains, or Ubuntu 24.04 with the open-source toolchain; OpenCode,
OpenCodeReview, OpenChamber, Docker CLI bridged to the host) runs on your
Mac. Your code stays on the host — you share a working directory into the VM
and let a coding agent work on it in an isolated sandbox. The
[`agent-dev-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-dev-env) CLI builds,
runs, and wires up the sandboxes, and manages their image releases.

**Currently supported:** macOS host on Apple Silicon → macOS (Tart),
Windows 11 ARM64 (QEMU, VMware Fusion) and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ARM64 (VMware
Fusion) guests. Linux hosts are coming soon.

## Quick start

Try it without installing:

```bash
npx agent-dev-env doctor            # host + tooling check for every platform
npx agent-dev-env run macos         # pull, boot, and wire up the macOS sandbox
```

Or install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g agent-dev-env
agent-dev-env run macos
```

Want the latest build from the `master` branch? The CI publishes a canary
build on every push to npm under the `canary` dist-tag:

```bash
npm install -g agent-dev-env@canary
```

On first use the CLI asks before pulling the image (one-time, ~50 GB for
macOS) and creating the working VM, then starts it with the recommended
settings. Every guest gets the host's SSH agent and Docker engine bridged
in; the macOS and Ubuntu guests additionally share your work directory and
copy your user settings in. What works where differs per guest — see the
[macOS guide](docs/macos.md), [Ubuntu guide](docs/ubuntu-vmware.md),
[Windows QEMU guide](docs/windows-qemu.md) or
[Windows VMware guide](docs/windows-vmware.md) for your OS, and the
[CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for every command and option.

> Tip: `agent-dev-env doctor` checks Tart/QEMU/Fusion/oras and free disk
> before you start; the per-platform guides list the official install
> commands.

## Guides

Pick the guide for your operating system:

| Operating system | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [Set up your macOS sandbox](docs/macos.md) |
| Ubuntu (VMware) | [Set up your Ubuntu sandbox](docs/ubuntu-vmware.md) |
| Windows (QEMU) | [Set up your Windows sandbox](docs/windows-qemu.md) |
| Windows (VMware) | [Set up your Windows VMware sandbox](docs/windows-vmware.md) |

Each guide starts with a short quick setup — macOS takes four steps, the
others three — and is all you need to have a sandbox with a coding agent
running.
